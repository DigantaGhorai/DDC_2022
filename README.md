## Session Title
Please provide the title of your session

## Authors
Your name (please include collaborators or funding institutions that have
supported this work) and links to your site or Github.

## Essential Questions
Questions that lead to a meaningful exploration of CS concepts and practices.
Examples:
* How can programming represent your ideas and beliefs?
* How might we use math (or other subjects) to express ourselves creatively?
* How might we use digital tools to impact our community?
* What information is my computer sharing about me or my online
activity?

## Introduction
Please provide a narrative of what the unit is about, and why we should learn
that is simple enough for a student to read and understand. For example: "In
this workshop, we will be using ... to explore ... so that you have a better
understanding of how ..."

## Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
What age range is this exercise designed for and what do students and
teachers need to know to be able to be successful in the workshop? Are there
any tools/toolkits they should already be comfortable with, any frameworks or
tools they should have installed before class?

## Outcomes & Goals
This can be easily answered by completing these example sentences:
* In this workshop, we will be... (writing, planning, soldering, setting up an
RPi home network, and making a wearable that communicates with....)
* Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of...
* Students will contemplate the ethical use of technology in terms of
social justice and inclusion.

## Materials
What prototyping tools will students or teachers need for lessons? This could
be anything from 3d printing designs to cardboard to Arduinos (we encourage
you to be as expansive and creative as possible.)

### Exercises To Do Before Class
What materials (readings, tasks, exercises) should students complete before class to be prepared for the lesson.

## Vocabulary
* Terms and language for the subject matter you are teaching, for
example, ‘Design Justice’.
* Program: A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific
task when executed by a computer.
* Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or
grammar rules) used to write programs.

## Exercise Descriptions
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of the class. Similar to pacing but with
more description of steps.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig
deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help
students progress their knowledge to the next level and gain mastery of the
subject through independent study.

an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
  * First Steps - a simple exercise
  * Next Steps - medium exercise
  * Big Steps - (hackathon, challenge, or open-ended study).
* Presentation: 
  * How might students share their work?
  * Will it be with peers or the outside world?
  * What media or platforms could and should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (Instagram, Tumblr...)?
* Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what they’ve learned in some creative way?'
