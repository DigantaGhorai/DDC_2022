## About DDC
Established in 1998, Digital Day Camp is Eyebeam’s longest running program, and one of the first-ever youth summer programs centered on new media education. This year's DDC theme is "Accessible Smart Cities and The Digital Twin."
### About Eyebeam 	

Established in the Chelsea district of Manhattan in 1998, Eyebeam was founded as a resource for artists to engage creatively with technology in a setting that encouraged experimentation. Today, we continue to be a resource for artists and technologists alike as technology’s effect on society grows increasingly complex and problematic. In all of our work, we strive to amplify artists’ ideas that carve a path towards a more just future.

Since 2001, the core of our programming has been our Residency, which evolved into a digital-first Fellowship in the last year. Every year we provide professional guidance, studio space, expert advice, and a significant cash award for up to 30 artists whose practices engage with the most pressing issues of our time. Unlike other fellowships, Eyebeam encourages inquiry-based practices through which artists can experiment and initiate critical dialogues with one another that are centered around technology’s effect on society. By supporting a multiplicity of artists responsive to systems of oppression, Eyebeam includes narratives that better reflect the existing plurality of genders, races, ethnicities, abilities, ages, sexual orientations, citizenships, and socioeconomic statuses in support of an expansively inclusive vision of a better future.
